# BokehFilter
:: implementation of a complex design for a bokeh image filter ::



A simple implementation of a fast and practical way to design a bokeh filter for gaming or digital image filtering.

Any image can be used

runFilter runs a visualization of the filter and shows before and after pictures.
As the names suggest runFilter_2comp has 2 components and 4comp has 4 components.
As you add more components, the filter is higher quality but is slower. 

Python Libraries:
- numpy
- math
